When I was planning a recent journey back to Riga, its food filled my thoughts more than anything else. I kept picturing the Latvian capitalâ€™s cafes, bistros and moody beer bars. Such longing was evidence, to me at least, that I was coming back to a city that knows how to feed people and with memorable flavours: smoked sprats, black pudding sausages,quince lemonade, cloudberry jam, pickled garlic, herby butters and bitter balsams tasting of liquorice.
